Measure of Central Tendency                  Outcomes of CLT are: the mean of the population is the mean of the sample stat,the sample follows                                               a Normal distribution and about the std(population)=std(sample)/size_of_sample

Random Variable:
discrete   ex: avg. salary of the citizens in a state (20k,50k,1M....)
continous  ex: height of the citzens in the state (170.4,145.7,156.9,.......)

in a Gaussian/Normal distribution , remember that 68%, 95%, 99.7%

Log Normal Distribution:
if a set of points follows a Log Normal Distribution , then it implies that the log of each point in the set when, depicted in a graph follows a Gaussian Distribution!!
Sentiment analysis usually follows Log Normal Distribution



Gaussian|Noraml to Standard Normal Distribution is when the mean is 0 and the std is 1 (scaling down=> Standard Scaling)


any distribution => Standard Normal Distribution in order for better accuracy of the model!!

    log -> Normal -> SND , this process is called as Log Normalisation
    


CHEBYSHEY'S ENEQUALITY:
if a Random variable doea not falls under the Normal distribution , what is the next move
so the percentages will not be like 68%,95%
it will be like 1+(1/k^2)


    
Co-Variance :
it quantifies the relation between the features
It helps to find out the direction of the relation

Negative: opposite 
Positive: same order, increases with increasing (but does not describes in what way they are related)
zero: No Relation

drawback of co variance is that, it does not specifies the strength of the relation...

PEARSON CO-RRELATION CO-EFFIECENT:
range(-1,1)


SPEARMAN'S RANK CORRELATION CO-EFFIECENT:
here the relation between the rank of x and y variable is considered
it describes the relation between two variables are described using a monotonic function
used for non-linear distribution with x and y

heatmap uses Spearman rank
